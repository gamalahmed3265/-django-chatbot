1. Make sure you have Python and Django installed. You can check if Django is installed by running the following command in your terminal: 
### Code snippet
```
python -m django --version
```
If you don't have Django installed, you can install it using pip:

Code snippet
```
pip install django
```
2. Create a Django project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
Code snippet
```
django-admin startproject myproject
```
This will create a new directory called `myproject` with all the files you need to start developing your Django app.

3. Create a Django app. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
Code snippet
```
python manage.py startapp myapp
```
This will create a new directory called `myapp` inside the `myproject` directory. This directory contains all the files you need to start developing your Django app.

4. Run the Django development server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
Code snippet
```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start a development server on your computer. You can access your Django app by opening a web browser and navigating to
```
http://localhost:8000.
```

5. Make changes to your Django app. Once you have your Django app running, you can make changes to the code and the development server will automatically reload the changes so you can see them in your web browser.

6. Deploy your Django app to production. Once you are happy with your Django app, you can deploy it to production. There are many ways to deploy a Django app, but a popular option is to use Heroku. You can find more information about deploying Django apps to Heroku here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django.
